create a single file html app that demonstrate band pass filter for input I should have options to record sound from mic or upload an audio file and then in the bandpass filter it will show the ranges of frequency available in the input , and the filter will have two range control using which I can set min and max frequency allowed the filter will then filter the frequecy on click of a button and generate an audio output that is filtered for that band and a play button to play the audio, try to do this all in html only , if somehow its not possible to do it all in html create a nodejs backend and that nodejs application should server the html, but make sure to check all possible options with only html first
